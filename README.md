# Pipette

Pipette is flow-based programming (FBP) framework for Elixir.

It utilizes `GenStage` to chain asynchronous processing stages, supporting loose connections and
routing.

One benefit of flow-based programming is to narrow the gap between prototype and production of
data processing systems.

## Flow-based programming

> In computer programming, flow-based programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm that
> defines applications as networks of "black box" processes, which exchange data
> across predefined connections by message passing,
> where the connections are specified externally to the processes.
>
> These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly
> to form different applications without having to be changed internally.
